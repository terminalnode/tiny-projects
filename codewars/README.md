This is a collection of exercices I've done from Codewars.com.

# Unfinished problems
List of exercices started but not yet finished, and what's wrong with them. (problems not listed here work as intended)

## Java
**(4k) Bird-mountain - The River:** Mistake in how the mountain flooding was implemented. Will fix at some point.

## Python
**(4k) Count squares in a chess board:** Problem is solved but solution runs too slow to meet performance requirements.
